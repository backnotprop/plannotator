/**
 * The bundled `plannotator` knowledge skill, offered to Pi only when no other
 * copy of it is loaded (#1642).
 *
 * The CLI installer (scripts/install.sh) writes the same skill to
 * ~/.agents/skills/plannotator, which Pi auto-discovers. When the package
 * declared the skill statically in `pi.skills`, every user with both installs
 * got a startup "[Skill conflicts]" warning: Pi ranks auto-discovered user
 * skills above package skills, keeps the first, and reports the other as
 * skipped. Contributing the skill from `resources_discover` instead lets the
 * extension look at what Pi already loaded and stay out of the way, so an
 * extension-only (npm) install still gets the skill and a CLI + extension
 * install loads exactly one copy: the installer's, which carries the user's
 * model-invocation choice.

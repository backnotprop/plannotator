The share portal is a static single-page application. It has no backend, no database, and makes no network requests. All plan data is encoded in the URL hash.

## Build

```bash
bun install
bun run build:portal
```

Output: `apps/portal/dist/`

## Deploy

Upload the `dist/` folder to any static hosting provider.

### Nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name plannotator.internal.example.com;
    root /var/www/plannotator;
    try_files $uri /index.html;
}
```

### AWS S3 + CloudFront

```bash
aws s3 sync apps/portal/dist/ s3://your-bucket/ --delete
```

Configure the CloudFront distribution to return `/index.html` for 404s (SPA routing).

### Vercel / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages

Point to the repository root:
- **Build command**: `bun run build:portal`
- **Output directory**: `apps/portal/dist`

## Configure Plannotator

Set the `PLANNOTATOR_SHARE_URL` environment variable to your portal's URL:

```bash
export PLANNOTATOR_SHARE_URL=https://plannotator.internal.example.com
```

All share links generated by Plannotator will now point to your self-hosted portal. The import dialog placeholder updates automatically.

When `PLANNOTATOR_SHARE_URL` is not set, the default `https://share.plannotator.ai` is used.

## Verify

1. Start a plan review in Claude Code or OpenCode
2. Add an annotation, click Export → Share
3. Confirm the share URL starts with your configured domain
4. Open the link — the plan and annotations should render correctly
